## Overview

DocuGenAI is an AI-powered assistant that automates the creation, management, and visualization of technical documents. It combines Prompt Engineering, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Multimodal Integration, and Synthetic Data Generation to enhance documentation workflows.

Built with an intuitive Streamlit UI, integrated with OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo models and ChromaDB vector store, DocuGenAI delivers a modern, scalable, and efficient solution for technical writers, developers, and teams.

## Key Features

Documentation Generator: Create API documentation, code explanations, troubleshooting guides, and code generation with AI.
Knowledge Base Management:
Upload ZIP files containing multiple file formats (.txt, .md, .json, .csv, .py, .html).
Generate synthetic documentation data for testing and training.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Retrieve relevant documents from ChromaDB to enrich AI-generated outputs.
Visualization Module: Interactive similarity graphs using PCA or t-SNE reduction and Plotly charts.
Modern Frontend: Beautiful and responsive Streamlit UI enhanced with custom CSS styling.
Technical Architecture

Programming Language: Python
Frontend: Streamlit UI with custom CSS.
Backend:
OpenAI API integration for documentation generation.
Prompt engineering and context retrieval.
Document processing and synthetic data generation using Faker.
Vector Store: ChromaDB for storing and retrieving document embeddings.
Visualization Layer:
PCA and t-SNE for dimensionality reduction.
Interactive visualization using Plotly.
Environment Management: Secure API key management using dotenv.
Results and Performance

Fast Document Generation: Few seconds per documentation task.
Knowledge Base Scalability: Supports hundreds of synthetic and real documents.
High Accuracy: >85% task completion accuracy observed through manual evaluation.
Efficient Visualization: Smooth document similarity mapping, even with large datasets.
Lessons Learned

Importance of fine-tuned Prompt Engineering.
Handling t-SNE instability with small datasets via dynamic perplexity.
The necessity of Secure API Key Management.
The value of Synthetic Data for robust testing.
Future enhancements include multi-model integration, semantic search, and user authentication.
How to Run the Project

# Prerequisites

Python 3.9+
Install required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Create a .env file in the project root with the following:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

Running the App

# Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/docugenai.git

cd docugenai
# Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the Streamlit app:

streamlit run Document.py

Open the local Streamlit URL in your browser (typically http://localhost:8501).
Optional

To visualize document similarity, ensure at least two documents are uploaded or generated.
To generate synthetic documentation samples, use the sidebar feature "âœª Generate Samples."
